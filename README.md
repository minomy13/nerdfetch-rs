**Acknowledgements:** Heavily inspired by [NerdFetch](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/nerdfetch) by ThatOneCalculator.
This project is a Rust-based reimagining with a similar aesthetic and minimalistic goals.

## Config
You can find the config file at `$HOME/.config/nerdfetch-rs.toml`. As the suffix might suggest, it is in TOML format.

## Installation

This software should work for most Linux distros and macOS. You **need** to have a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
installed and enabled in your terminal.

### Package manager

- **AUR.**
- **Homebrew.**
- **NIX.**
- **Cargo / build from source.** For installation with Cargo (especially if you're on a Debian or Red Hat based system)
  use `cargo install --git https://github.com/minomy13/nerdfetch-rs`. Of course, you have to have a Rust toolchain
  up and running.
